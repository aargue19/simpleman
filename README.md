GUI that standardizes words

On startup the app loads a file called "test_df.csv".

It has the following columns:
"id": int, 
"game_num": int, 
"word": str, 
"game_name": str, 
"game_description": str,
"stemmed_word": str,
"changed_word": str, 
"remark": str, 
"std_word": str,
"std2": str

The app saves all the data to a file called data_output.csv

It's slow af because I suck at coding.

May the force be with you.
